* Fix all the functions that work on words, they have to view words as UTF-8
  and not just bytes.
  - This includes BUTFIRST, BUTLAST, ITEM, etc. (FIRST and LAST are done) We
    also add new functions so we still have access to bytes (i.e. FIRSTBYTE)
  - Make sure the lexer works as expected; long term we could look into
    offering support for extended character sets (i.e. recognize other
    digits, fractions, signs/punctuation, etc.)

* Actually write tests to verify every thing (i.e. full coverage, especially for a language!)

* Add support for a Logo library (i.e. libraries written in logo that we
  can link against)

* Add support to interface with C functions, right now we can only call
  Logo functions.
